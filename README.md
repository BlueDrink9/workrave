## Build

This document only discusses compilation on Unix (like OSes).  
Information on how to compile Workrave on Windows can be found in
- `build/cmake/README` (native compilation on windows) and
- `build/win32/README` (cross-compilation on Linux)

Read the 'INSTALL' file for more detailed directions on compilation on
Unix and OSX.

Workrave requires that development packages of at least the following
software are installed. The version numbers mentioned have been tested
during development.

- GLib (2.16.0)
- GLibmm (2.19.3)
- Gtk (2.16.0)
- Gtkmm (2.16.0)
- Atk (1.20)
- Pango (1.22.0)
- Pangomm (2.14.0)
- Cairo (1.2.4)
- Cairomm (1.6.4)
- DBus (1.0.2)
- DBus-Glib (0.78)
- GConf (2.13.5)
- GConfmm (2.22.0)
- GDome
- GStreamer (0.10.10)
- Libsigc++ (2.0.2)
- Autoconf with Autoconf Macro Archive (2012.04.04)

Optionally, the following packages are required for gnome support.

- ORbit (2.14.10)
- Bonobo (2.15.0)
- panel-applet (2.19.3)

For OS X, the following steps will install sufficient packages
1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
2. `brew install gettext intltool gobject-introspection autoconf-archive gtk+ gtk-mac-integration gtkmm3`
3. `brew link --force gettext libffi`

Both developers and regular users should install `gnome-icon-theme` and `hicolor-icon-theme`

## Troubleshooting

### Show timers applet in Cinnamon
To make timers visible you need to explicitly add Workrave applet to a panel. In the other case only workrave icon is shown.

## Technical Information
Have a look at the [contrib](./contrib) directory to get a little insight into the different scripting possibilities!

### Unix/Linux
- Workrave uses [dconf](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/dconf) to store its configuration. 
  `dconf-editor` can be used to explore and manipulate the values - be careful!
- Workrave can receive [dbus](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/) signals.
  Explore by having a look at the [example python script](./backend/src/dbus-example.py) or viewing in `qdbusviewer` (part of the `qttools5-dev-tools` package in Ubuntu).

In both of these, workrave is found under the `org.workrave` key.

### OS X

OS X support is limited, but it will work under the right conditions. See [#89](https://github.com/rcaelers/workrave/issues/89) for information and progress.
